maildir-utils (mu) vs notmuch
  re-indexing the same maildir's
    https://gist.github.com/johnnyutahh/f4e3d2d3fb07de5fa146
    notmuch   = 11-15 seconds
    maildir-utils = 170-190 seconds
    +10 for notmuch
  maildir-utils (mu) embeds data in IMAP server, notmuch does not
    +1 for maildir-utils
    muchsync enables notmuch syncing across machines
      even if not as convenient
      +0.75 for notmuch
  for me (johnnyutahh), it's not even close
    notmuch is so much faster indexing (10-15 times faster) than maildir-utils,
      that I'll happily jump through extra syncing (muchsync, etc) hoops
  question - am I not configuring/executing maildir-utils correctly?
    could that explain its poor performance?
